Data handling notes:

- The dataset is loaded automatically using `sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`.
- This repository does not store raw datasets or large generated outputs.
- Running the notebook will generate local artifacts under `data/` (e.g., chunks, embeddings, CSV results),
  which are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
