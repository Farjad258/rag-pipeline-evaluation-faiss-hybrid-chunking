# Generated Figures

The evaluation code generates multiple figures to analyze different aspects of retrieval and chunking behavior.  
While only the most relevant figures are included in the IEEE Access manuscript, all figures are documented here for completeness and reproducibility.

## Figures Generated by the Code

### Fig1_Token_F1.png
Token-level F1 score across retrieval and chunking configurations.

### Fig1_ROUGE_L.png
ROUGE-L scores comparing answer overlap quality across configurations.

### Fig1_Hallucination_Rate.png
Hallucination token rate for each retrieval–chunking combination.

### Fig1_Answer_Length.png
Average generated answer length across configurations.

### Fig2_Token_F1.png
Interaction between retrieval strategy and chunking method for Token F1.

### Fig2_Hallucination_Rate.png
Interaction between retrieval strategy and chunking method for hallucination rate.

## Usage in the Paper

- The IEEE Access manuscript includes **Fig. 2 (Token F1 interaction)** and **Fig. 2 (Hallucination rate interaction)**, as these most directly support the core experimental findings.
- The remaining figures are provided here to support extended analysis and reproducibility, but are not required for the main narrative of the paper.
