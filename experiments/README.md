This folder is reserved for scripted experiment runners and ablation studies.

At present, all experiments are executed end-to-end via the Jupyter notebook
in `notebooks/RAG_Project.ipynb`.

Future work may include:
- Standalone experiment scripts (e.g., `run_experiments.py`)
- Parameterized ablation studies
- Automated evaluation pipelines
